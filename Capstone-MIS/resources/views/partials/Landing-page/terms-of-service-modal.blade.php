          By accessing or using the Information Management System (IMS) for Citizen Requests, PWD and Elderly Assistance, and Aid Distribution, users agree to comply with these Terms of Service. The system is intended exclusively for official government operations, including registering beneficiaries, managing aid distribution, organizing documents, providing SMS updates, and generating reports for MSWDO and barangay units. Users are responsible for keeping their login credentials secure and for ensuring that all information they enter is accurate and truthful. Unauthorized activities—such as accessing another user’s data, falsifying records, sharing passwords, tampering with documents, misusing government information, or attempting to breach system security—are strictly prohibited and may result in account suspension, administrative action, or legal consequences. Although the IMS is designed to be reliable, it may experience downtime due to maintenance, network issues, or unforeseen technical problems; SMS notifications may also occasionally fail due to external carrier limitations. The LGU does not guarantee uninterrupted service but strives to maintain system stability and security. All system content, including the platform design, database structure, and code, is the intellectual property of the LGU and may not be copied or distributed without authorization. Continued use of the system indicates acceptance of any updates to these terms. For questions or concerns, users may contact the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) or the system administrator.
