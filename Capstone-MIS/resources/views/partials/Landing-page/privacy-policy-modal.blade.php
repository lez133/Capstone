          The Information Management System (IMS) for Citizen Requests, PWD and Elderly Assistance, and Aid Distribution is committed to protecting the privacy of all users, including beneficiaries, MSWDO personnel, and barangay representatives. This system collects and stores personal information such as names, birthdates, contact numbers, ID numbers, addresses, and submitted documents to support beneficiary registration, aid distribution, and official government transactions. Additional system data, such as login records and activity logs, may also be collected to ensure security and proper system usage. Information gathered is used solely for public service delivery—such as scheduling aid, verifying beneficiary identity, sending SMS notifications, generating reports, and managing program requirements. Data is stored securely in a MySQL database and accessed only by authorized personnel through role-based permissions. We do not sell, transfer, or share personal data with unauthorized parties; information is disclosed only to designated MSWDO staff, barangay representatives, official government agencies when required, or SMS service providers responsible for delivering notifications. Users have the right to request access to their data, correct inaccuracies, or raise concerns regarding data handling. The IMS retains personal information only as long as necessary for public service and compliance with government policies. By using this platform, users agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any updates or changes to this policy will be posted directly within the system.
